# Assignment 3: Discrete Normals, Curvatures, and Smoothing (Optional)

This repository is modified based on 
[libigl-example-project](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-example-project/);
no useful code is provided this time. You will use the libigl tutorial code to get
started as suggested in the assignment.

With implicit smoothing, time steps can be much larger and converge faster to smoothest surface ie. 2-sphere

Explicit smoothing requires much smaller time steps and, if the time step is too large, can fail to converge.
